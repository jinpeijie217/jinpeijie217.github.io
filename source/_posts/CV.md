1. image augmentation: increase the boarder fitness and decrease the dependency on some features like position
	- left-right and rolling
	- color-changing
	- multi-changing
2. fine-tune is one of the most important transfer learning, and the output layer should be modified to the targeted dataset
3. object-detection and bounding box
4. Jaccard index is used to evaluate the similarity of two sets. A*B/A+B
5. there are two loss of object detection : the loss of anchor classification + the loss of biases 
6. semantic segmentation, image segmentation, and instance segmentation
7. Pascal VOC2012 is important for semantic segmentation
8. style transferring
9. need more kaggle practice!!!

**models**
1. SSD, single shot multibox detection: Multi-box object detection model, with one basic NN block + multiple anchor blocks
2. R-CNN,  region-based CNN: Fast R-CNN + Faster R-CNN + Mask R-CNN
3. FCN, fully convolutional network: transposed convolution could be used to modify the size of feature maps
